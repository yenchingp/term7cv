# Inventory Management CV Project SUTD

## 50.035 CV 2023 Group 14

This is used for SUTD 50.035 Computer Vision project, inventory management using SKU-110K dataset(dense object detection)

To use, first make sure all necessary packages are installed from "requirements.txt".
Once done, simply run "GUI.py". Note that an internet connection is needed to download model weights.

For bandwidth value, a smaller value leads to more clusters being estimated. Values of 0.2 - 0.8 work well for most of the images in our dataset.
